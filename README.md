# Keep a logbook

I think you should write down the things that you do every day. Even the
mundane and uneventful days. Especially the mundane and uneventful days.
Not for any particular reason except to not forget when you normally
would.

## DO IT

### Dev

Get this running:

```javascript
npm run dev-server
npm run start-dev
```

Then go to `http://localhost:8080`. React hot-loading? Hell yeah.
